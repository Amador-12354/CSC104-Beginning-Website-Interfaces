
portfolio_home.html
This is the first page that viewer will start at. It has the code of the navigation menu, a hero class, a left class, a right class, and a footer class. The nav items are the different pages the will be found in every header. The hero class is under main and has the left and right class under it. The left class it holds my headshot that will appear on the right side with a white bar below it with a YouTube, GitHub, and LinkedIn icons that later in the future will direct them to my social medias to view how my codes work and how to reach out to me. The right class has my name and then a little paragraph of who I am, what I want to become when I am out of college and what I do for fun. The footer class just has again icons for viewers to click on them and an email to contact me. Right below, there is a script for the navigation menu to appear under the three lines on the left top side of the header.

portfolio_home.css
This code consist of all the CSS styling used to make the home page look the way it does. The hero will flex display, have space between content, have a minimum height of 100vh, some padding, make sure the text color will be in white, and just the same stuff for the rest of the styling. Just some padding, height and weight for the profile and the white bar below it. 

portfolio_objectives.html
The objectives page will consist of the six objectives for my degree that my projects need to meet to pass my boards class. Then, it has the same basic code like the portfolio_home.html file with the navigation menu, the footer, and the script.

portfolio_objectives.css
This file has all the styling for portfolio_objective.html. It has the header be white and centered. The rest of any test will be white as well. For the flex-column it has a transparent dark background so words can be seen. The .obj class just shows how the display will look and make that the objectives are stacked vertically. The footer just makes sure the text is black for the white footer.

portfolio_contact.html
This file will have the form and the table requirements. The form will allow users to input their information of their name, email, and a text area for them to leave a message of what they wanted. The table will just have how to contact me. Right now it has a placeholder for the email, phone, and a text for where to place LinkedIn link. Finally, it has the same basic stuff like the header, footer, and navigation menu.

portfolio_contact.css
This is where the CSS will be found for portfolio_contact.html. Just making sure everything is centered, with padding and margins sizes. For all buttons, when users hover over the background will turn yellow. For the table I made sure to center the title and just make the text size big. Just make sure that all text is visible with the dark background image.

portfolio_projects.html
This code will have the same repeated header, navigation menu, and footer. In the main you will find the coding projects with a paragraph with the placeholder where a quick description of what the project is what will be found. There is a placeholder image and a heading at the top of the name of the project.

portfolio_projects.css
Here will be the CSS styling for the portfolio_projects.html to keep headings centered, black, a white background, and make sure the containers could be next to each other horizontal and have the pictures appear above each container.

portfolio_resume.html
This code again has the same stuff before the main and after the main. In the main code, there will be a class for the resume. There is a button where viewer would be able to download my resume. Just some information about my education and experience. 

portfolio_resume.css
Nearly all the CSS is similar. It will mostly be making sure everything is centered and that the containers are wrapped vertically. 

portfolio_main.css
Here is all the CSS styling that will be global. So this is where the background image is set that is found every page. The CSS for the header, footer, and navigation menu. Hovering of the links will be blue. This is where the icons will be displayed inline with gap. The JavaScript for the navigation menu and the media for the small screens.
